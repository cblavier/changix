# Changix

Very small & simple Elixir library that gives you changelog features based on a bunch of markdown files.
Since it leverages on Elixir _metaprogramming_ features, everything is done at compile time, none at runtime.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `changix` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:changix, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

## Usage

TODO

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/changix](https://hexdocs.pm/changix).
